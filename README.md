The Undergrads Guide to Computational Materials Science

This is a guide for undergraduates who are curious or are interested in learning about computational materials, how quantum mechanics (or quantum chemistry) is used to study materials, or are interested in developing your programming skills.

This is structured in three different sections:
* Theory
* Software
* Next Steps
