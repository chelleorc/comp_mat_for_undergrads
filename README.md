The Undergrads Guide to Computational Materials Science

This is a guide for undergraduates who are curious or are interested in learning about computational materials, how quantum mechanics (or quantum chemistry) is used to study materials, or are interested in developing your programming skills.

This is structured in three different sections:
* Theory
    ** This is a brief introduction to quantum mechanics, quantum materials, and the techniques used to study materials

* Software
    ** This is where the coding happens. This will include code snippets to help you get started, instructions on installing software that's typically used in the materials science field, and techniques used to optimize your computations
* Next Steps
    ** A brief set of next steps to take to continue developing your skills. This includes additional software packages, high performance computing, and techniques used to study materials.
